          <p>You are able to post all kinds of things on Clikd, including photographs, messages and other content (&ldquo;Content&rdquo;).</p>
          <p>There are some rules about what is acceptable though, so when you are using Clikd you may not&nbsp;post or send any Content which:</p>

          <ol>

            <li><p>is obscene, pornographic or otherwise may offend human dignity;</p></li>
            <li><p>is abusive, insulting or threatening, or which promotes or encourages racism, sexism, hatred or bigotry;</p></li>
            <li><p>encourages any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism, inciting racial hatred or the submission of which in itself constitutes committing a criminal offence;</p></li>

          </ol>

          <p>Please use your common sense when picking the Content that you choose to post on or send via Clikd because you are solely responsible for, and bear all liability in relation to, such Content.</p>

          <h4>Are there any rules relating to personal information like my email address?</h4>
          <p>You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page (&ldquo;Profile&rdquo;) whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details). If you do choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances.</p>

          <h4>What about other people&rsquo;s personal information, can I use it?</h4>
          <p>You may only use other Clikd user&rsquo;s personal information to the extent that your use of it matches Clikd&rsquo;s purpose of allowing people to meet one another. You may not use other users&#39; information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. Clikd reserves the right to terminate your account if you misuse other users&#39; information.</p>

          <h4>Who can see the Content that I put on Clikd?</h4>
          <p>When you upload Content to Clikd it can be accessed and viewed by the general public. If you do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you can opt to use the private folders and select the person to whom you wish to give access. If you still do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you should not upload it to Clikd.</p>
          <p>We reserve the right (without obligation) at our sole discretion and without giving you notice, to remove or edit, limit or block access to any Content that you upload or submit to Clikd without any incurring liability to you. We have no obligation to display any Content that you submit to Clikd, nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to Clikd, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of Clikd.</p>

          <h3>2. Ownership of Content</h3>
          
          <h4>Once I have uploaded Content on Clikd, do I still own it?</h4>

          <p>Yes (provided you are the rightful owner in the first place &mdash; please see our other rules regarding posting Content that doesn&rsquo;t belong to you).</p>
          <p>Please note though that by posting or sending Content on Clikd you represent and warrant to us that you have the right to do so, and automatically grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, worldwide licence to use such Content in any way (including, without limitation, editing, copying, modifying, adapting, translating, reformatting, creating derivative works from, incorporating into other works, advertising, distributing and otherwise making available to the general public such Content, whether in whole or in part and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future).</p>
          <p>We may assign and/or sub-licence the above licence to our affiliates and successors without any further approval by you.</p>
          <p>By submitting Content to Clikd you are warranting that you are the exclusive author and owner of that Content and you agree that you waive any and all moral rights relating to that Content (including, without limitation, the right to be identified as the author).</p>
          <p>We have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any Content posted or uploaded by you to our app or site constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights or of their right to privacy or any other law.</p>

          <h4>Who does the rest of the Content on Clikd belong to then?</h4>
          <p>Us! All text, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds and artwork on Clikd are owned, controlled or licensed by us and are protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights.</p>
          
          <h4>Can I use any of the Content that doesn&rsquo;t belong to me?</h4>
          <p>Other than in relation to Content submitted by you to Clikd, you do not have any rights in relation to the Content on Clikd and you agree that you will not use any Content in any manner which may infringe any third party&rsquo;s rights. Without limitation to the foregoing, this means that you agree that you will not copy, modify, adapt, distribute, publish or sell all or any part of the Clikd site or the Content contained on it (other than the Content submitted by you) to anyone else.</p>

          <h3>3. Paid for Services</h3>

          <h4>What can I buy on Clikd?</h4>
          <p>Clikd offers you the opportunity to pay for certain services offered on the site. All of these premium services can be purchased after you register, and you may subscribe to the premium services for various lengths of time. Once you have paid for any premium services, they are non-refundable. You can change your Auto Top-up at anytime in your payment settings on your profile page. The pricing may vary due to a number of factors, such as (but not limited to) promotional offers, loyalty bonuses and other discounts that might apply to your age group.</p>

          <h4>How do I renew my premium services with Clikd?</h4>
          <p>Once you have requested a Clikd premium service, you authorise Clikd to charge your chosen payment method. If you want to cancel or change your payment method at any time, you can do so either via the payment settings option under your profile or by contacting your mobile service provider. If your chosen payment method is via your mobile service provider, then please check with them about their payment terms, as their payment terms will govern how payments to Clikd are made as well as how such payments may be changed or cancelled. Your subscription to Clikd&rsquo;s premium services will automatically renew until you decide to cancel, and if you have enabled the auto top-up feature, your account will automatically be topped up until you decide to disable this feature.</p>

          <h3>4. Access to the app and site</h3>
          
          <h4>Do you guarantee that Clikd will be up and running at all times?</h4>
          <p>Unfortunately we can&rsquo;t guarantee that because sometimes we have to carry out maintenance to the app or site or they may be affected by a fault or circumstances which are outside our control, so Clikd is provided on an &ldquo;as is&rdquo; basis. No warranty is given about the quality, accuracy, functionality, availability or performance of Clikd and we reserve the right to suspend, withdraw, amend, modify or vary the service provided on Clikd without notice and without incurring any liability to you.</p>

          <h4>What about mobile access?</h4>

          <p>You are responsible for making all the necessary arrangements to ensure you can access Clikd (including, but not limited to Internet provider and mobile internet provider fees and, any other charges associated with such access). We shall not be held responsible for any reduced functionality you may encounter as result of or in connection with accessing Clikd through mobile services or any similar service currently known or developed in the future.</p>
          <p>By accessing Clikd or agreeing to receive messages or notifications from Clikd through your mobile phone and/or any other connected media device, you accept that you may incur charges from your internet or mobile service provider. We shall not under any circumstances be liable for such charges.</p>

          <h3>5. Termination of use by us</h3>
          
          <h4>My Profile has disappeared and I can&rsquo;t log in. What&rsquo;s going on?</h4>

          <p>Sometimes people forget about the Terms and post Content or act in a way while on Clikd which is not consistent with the purpose of the app or site. If we think that you may be one of those people, then we reserve the right at our sole discretion, at any time and without liability or the need to give you prior notice or to refund any unused services to:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>suspend or revoke your registration (where applicable) and your right to access and/or use Clikd or submit any Content to Clikd; and</li>
            <li>make use of any operational, technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses).</li>
          </ol>

          <p>We will try (but we are not obliged) to notify you if your access to Clikd and/or your Profile is to be or has been suspended or terminated.</p>

          <h3>6. Termination of use by you</h3>
          
          <h4>I want to &ldquo;unregister&rdquo; myself from Clikd, how does that work?</h4>

          <p>If you have registered on Clikd, you can terminate your registration at any time by going to the &lsquo;Settings&rsquo; control on Clikd when you are logged in and choosing the &lsquo;delete profile&rsquo; link. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Clikd. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it. Once your registration is terminated, we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to Clikd. For further details, please refer to our Privacy Policy.</p>

          <p>Content that you have uploaded to Clikd, other than your Profile (such as comments or email messages), may still appear on Clikd following termination of your registration.</p>

          <h3>7. Abuse/Complaints</h3>

          <h4>Someone is not obeying the Terms, what can I do?</h4>
          <p>You can report any abuse or complain about Content on Clikd by contacting us via Feedback page, outlining the abuse and or complaint. You can also report a user directly from a profile, by clicking the &lsquo;Report Abuse&rsquo; link on their profile, choosing the reason for the complaint and providing us with any additional information you think fit.</p>
          <p>We will always try our best to help resolve any issue that you may encounter with our service. If your complaint or dispute remains unresolved, however, you may be eligible to use the European Commission&rsquo;s Online dispute resolution platform <ExternalLink to="https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage">here</ExternalLink>.</p>

          <h3>8. Privacy Policy</h3>

          <h4>Do you have guidelines in place about what you can do with my personal data?</h4>
          <p>We process information in accordance with our Privacy Policy which is incorporated into these Terms and Conditions of Use.

If you access these links you may be directed to third party sites. These third party sites will have their own terms of use and privacy policies, which may differ from the Terms.

          <p>Please note that we have no control over the contents of any third party sites or resources, and we accept no responsibility for them, including (but not limited to) the third party site&rsquo;s compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.</p>

          <h3>10. Disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability</h3>
          
          <h4>I forgot the rules about conduct on here and now someone is threatening to sue me. Will your lawyers sort it out?</h4>
          <p>No. If you act in a way that upsets other users then you have to be responsible for the consequences. We expressly disclaim any and all responsibility and liability for your conduct or the conduct of any other user of Clikd, and expressly disclaim any liability for Content uploaded by you or by any other user.</p>

          <p>However please note that nothing in the Terms limits or excludes our liability for:</p>

            <li><p>death or personal injury caused by our proven negligence; or</p></li>

          </ol>

          <h3>11. Indemnity</h3>

          <p>If we are sued as a result of your use of Clikd then we have the right to defend or settle the relevant claim as we see fit. If we ask, you will co-operate fully and reasonably as required by us in the defence of any relevant claim.</p>
